Totally on-site good opportunity if u like travelling throughout India! No limits on travelling PAN India!,"Inexperienced, Inappropriate, mannerless, uncultured, useless leads are being appointed. Who himself is just 6months experienced! Total egoistic & irratic behavioured recruits who are based in the company from ages. Bangalore is just to attract opportunity seekers. Once you go on-site there‚Äôs no coming back which is not told to you initially. And this is an off role third party employer and not on role for TATA POWER. No incentives, lot of travelling, no proper training on SAP given just because they think that the employee might resign anytime! Instead of talking  discussing abt induction & on job training. Things like how long will you be in this company? How much salary has been offered to you? Be here for a year later we will make sure you get placed in a better position & salary, these things are being discussed. Which according to me is very discouraging & totally unprofessional. Aspiring QS & Planning Engineers please do not go for this job just for salary sake!...Read More"

Senior Manager(CSM),Kolkata,Full Time,CVBU Department,09-Jun-22,3,1,4,4,5,3,1,"Bad things:
CSM(CVBU) life is the worst.. no balance of work and personal life.. If you don't pick up the phone at mid nights of CAC calls then your boss will reflect the same during ratings. 
L3 management takes credit for all the good things no matter what life risking effort L4(ASM) and L5(CSM) are giving. Basically once you starts asking questions and raising support for concern areas you will become a member of hit list. They (L3) will never guide you about how to do but will ask for results although in some region exceptional people are there who are true leaders and they really cares for their juniors.
Unnecessary review by top management in every week and no time for implementation of the same.
Handling CAC calls along with customers for 3.3hrs(counted) apart from this other calls(Daily call count avg 110-130), unnecessary meetings(VC) will block your entire calendar for the day and EOD you will be asked what have you done.
 
Due to poor middle management(in some region) bottom employees are struggling and middle management showing creamy dreamy world to top management.
Good things:
Ocean of learning.
Good policies specially health.
Good travel policy.
Job security was good but middle management will keep on threatening.
Once you join you will get a good grip on your technical skills.
Advice to company:
Please don't think that CSM can work for 24/7 either start with shift working or appoint breakdown teams at each AO or cluster wise....Read More","24/7 working, No work life balance, unnecessary weekly review by top management where there is no direction or sop derivatives."

You are always kept in under a carrot approach that you will be given a permanent job if u stay overtime and do extra work for free.
transport also is charged for contractual employees.Rs 1000 per month.
as a contractual you are given step motherly treatment and not even invited for funtions and not even given medical cover.
You are placed lowest (contractual) in hierarchy and not given importance even if u r talented .
Other things are fine...Dont join company on contract basis.you will get 20000 on paper. after deduction transport..pf and shutdown days you will be handed 13000-15000 in hand .
